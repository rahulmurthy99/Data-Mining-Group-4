ADSP 31008 Data Mining Principles: Week 10 Final Project for Group 4 - Alzheimer's Disease Dataset

In our ongoing efforts to enhance early diagnosis and intervention for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis leveraging patient health data, sourced from Kaggle, to provide critical insights. The purpose of this analysis is to predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's Disease in patients and to identify the key factors associated with the onset of the disease. By examining a wide array of health predictors, we aim to develop a more accurate predictive model that can inform clinical decision-making and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The insights derived from this study have the potential to advance our understanding of Alzheimer's Disease, facilitating earlier and more targeted interventions that could slow the progression of the disease and improve the quality of life for those affected.


The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, has undergone prior sanitization and includes key attributes for 2,149 patients. The data encompasses a wide array of factors, inclusive of demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical measurements, cognitive and functional assessments, symptoms, and a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.
